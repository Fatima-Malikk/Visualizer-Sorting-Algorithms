## Visualizer-Sorting-Algorithms
The project is a sorting visualizer developed with Javascript and using HTML and CSS for its
user interface.
The webpage displays different sorting algorithms in the form of bar charts, and the workings of
different selected sorting algorithms can be seen easily.
This project utilizes Javascript to visualize different types of sorting algorithms using a bar chart.
User can reset the array by clicking the button and experiment with different sorting
algorithms to see how they differ. As well as it also shows the total sorting time.

Time complexity of the sorting algorithm

● Insertion Sort:
    O(n)
● Bubble Sort:
    O(n2)
● Merge Sort:
  O(n log n)
● Heap Sort:
  O(n log n).
● Quick sort:
  O(n*log n)
● Radix Sort:
  O(d*(n+b))
● Bucket Sort:
  O(n + k)
● Courting sort:
  O(n + k)
